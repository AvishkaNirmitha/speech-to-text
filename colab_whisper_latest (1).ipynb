It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

            " Albert Einstein grew up in a middle class family. When he was born in his family was scared that something was wrong with him and he had very large in miss shape and head. But fortunately within the first few weeks the shape of his head became normal. But their worries didn't stop there when he was very young. His parents thought he might be intellectually disabled because he was very slow to learn to talk and did not speak until he was 4 years old. At that time he often formed foody sentences in his throat but did not speak his use to practice the sentences in his head or whisper them softly under his breath until he got them right and then say them aloud. Many people believed Einstein would never succeed at anything when he was 5 years old his father. His interest in the subject when Einstein was only 10 years old. He was very good at writing. He started educating himself by the age of 12. Einstein thought himself geometric by the age of 15. He mastered calculus but he hated the disciplined and rigid style of the teachers so he dropped out of school and at the age of 15 he left Germany. He was born in Hamburg in Germany to avoid military service. He left Germany but escuched German language a lot. He studied in prayers at your place younger than 20 and entered the military school.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
